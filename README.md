# DevOpsLab Projects

## Overview

**DevOpsLab Projects** is a curated collection of **hands-on cloud and DevOps implementations** designed to demonstrate practical experience with **AWS, Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD, and serverless architectures**.

Each project in this repository reflects **real-world design patterns**, focusing on security, scalability, and automation rather than simple demos.

---

## Repository Structure

Each directory represents a **standalone project** with its own documentation, architecture, and implementation details.
